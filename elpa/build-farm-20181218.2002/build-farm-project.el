;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides an interface for displaying projects of a build
;; farm in 'list' and 'info' buffers.

;;; Code:

(require 'bui)
(require 'build-farm)
(require 'build-farm-url)
(require 'build-farm-build)
(require 'build-farm-jobset)

(build-farm-define-entry-type project
  :search-types '((all . build-farm-project-url))
  :filter-names '((name . id)
                  (displayname . name))
  ;; Also there is `hidden' boolean field, but it is useless because it
  ;; is the same thing as `enabled': when `hidden' is 1, `enabled' is 0,
  ;; and vice versa.  So `hidden' is not going to be used anywhere.
